    <p>Hello!</p>

I have 7+ years of experience in the motion industry, creating numerous high profile and award-winning campaigns.</p>
    <p>Most recently I was Senior Creative at Animade where I worked as a Director, Designer and Team Lead to produce exciting animation for TV and online. I worked closely with their regular clients including Facebook, IBM and Virgin America.</p>
    <p>I have also worked in senior and lead motion design roles in many London studios such as MPC, The Mill and Nexus.</p>
